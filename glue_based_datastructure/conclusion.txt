traditional data structures:
we need to add the objects into that data structure


glue based data structures:
the reverse, we need to add the data structure into the objects
example: we need to add the pointer for the next, prev for the object (employee, student)


so if we following the first way, if we need to add the object to 3 LinkedLists
so we need to add it three times

but now, we will allocate it once
and add into it 3 pointers to work with 3 different Data structures

so here, we will use the same object

and if we decided to remove it ,we can remove it by o(n) (using left, right pointers)
from all data structures instead of 3n
because in the traditional data structures, we need to loop through the data structure and remove it
