the purpose of this project, simulate adding private members as OOP languages (c++, java, ..)

for attributes:
the way we can achieve this by declare the struct in the .h file
and in the .c add the real implementation


for functions:
the way we can achieve this by adding the function directly into .c file
instead of define the prototype on .h file
